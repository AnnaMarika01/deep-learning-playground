## Project Overview
This project tackles the automatic prediction of online product prices based on the Mercari Price Suggestion Challenge. The objective is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts product prices using features such as name, category, brand, item condition, and description.  
The dataset contains approximately 1.5 million entries. The project includes data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering for multiple models, and performance evaluation using appropriate metrics.

## Repository Contents
- **`PriceSuggestion.ipynb`** — Jupyter notebook containing the full code to replicate the results presented in the report.  
- **`PriceSuggestion.pdf`** (italian)— Project report written in LaTeX and exported as a PDF.  
- **`train.tsv`** — **Not included**. You can download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elizabethsam/mercari-price-suggestion-challenge).  
- **`df_preprocessed.csv`** — **Not included**. This file can be generated by running the notebook, which saves the preprocessed dataset to speed up future experiments.

## Notes
- Make sure to download `train.tsv` manually before running the notebook.
- Running the notebook will create and save `df_preprocessed.csv` automatically.
